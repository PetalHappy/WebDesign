<h1>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h1>
<h2>A Novel be J.K. Rowling</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite books. I enjoy how the characters are developed and in this book in particular we get to know Professor Snape. Harry also learns more about himself and how playing with magic spells can be dangerous. Harry once again learns to look to his friends for help and guidance.</p>
