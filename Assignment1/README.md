# Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
## A Novel by J.K. Rowling

This is one of my favorite books. I enjoy how the characters are developed and in this book in particular we get to know Professor Snape. Harry also learns more about himself and how playing with magic spells can be dangerous. Harry once again learns to look to his friends for help and guidance.

I am trying out many different fonts, sizes, borders and backgrounds. It's a lot of fun and a lot of saving between changes so I can view each change as I make them. I'm finding simple is sometimes better and easier to read.
