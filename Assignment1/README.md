# Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

## Simple may be better.

 I am trying out many different fonts, sizes, borders and backgrounds. It's a lot of fun and a lot of saving between changes, so I can view each change as I make them. I'm finding simple is sometimes better and easier to read. I tried to add in an image but I could not get it centered on all screens. One monitor it looked perfect, but when I switched to my main screen it was off center. This was very distracting. So I removed the image. 
 
 The changes I chose to stick with were adding background color to my chapter headers and altering the fonts. I made the color of the new headers a bit lighter than the main header so it still followed the same color scheme. I changed the font style and font sizes of each header per some of the feedback I received from classmates. I think the changes made my page more welcoming and fun.
