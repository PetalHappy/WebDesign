This week's topics and assignment was very informative and I enjoyed adding so many more elements to my website. I think the table will be useful. Formatting the gallery was really cool. I can see myself using that when making sites in the futur. Especially when listing items for sale. The one thing I tried to do but could not get it to work, was spreading out the Nav titles. I will keep trying. Also, at the beginning I could not get the style sheet to work with the Favorites page. I found that have the ! was hindering the CSS from loading. The page was working online but would not take the CSS details. Once the ! was removed from the DOCTYPE, it worked! It's funny how such a small change can make a big difference.
